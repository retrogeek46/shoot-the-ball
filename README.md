# shoot-the-ball
A top down shooter made in Unity

Assumption:
1. This is a top down shooter
2. Only one letter from question is showed at a time
3. Next question is only shown when all circles have been destroyed
4. Question word shouldn't have same letter twice, or it gets deleted from question but
   still falls from the ball.

Gameplay:
Three circles will fall from above with letters in them, a question word will be shown at top left.
You start with three lives. Aim is to hit correct circle and destroy the word, letter by letter.

Controls:
1. Move gun using mouse. Hold 'A' to calibrate.
2. Press left mouse button to fire bullet.

Rules:
1. Each correct hit adds a point to score
2. Each incorrect hit deducts one life
3. Each correct letter that is not destroyed before reaching the line, deducts one life
4. Incorrect letters that reach the line do nothing to score or lives
5. At the end accuracy is calcualted based on number of shots fired and correct shots

Easter Eggs:
1. Clicking on "Times Played" will change live's image to pictorial representation of question
2. Clicking on gun let's you cycle through different models, no effect on bullets or fire rate

Suggestions/Further Work:
1. Theme's can be added (circles can be coconuts falling from tree's, adds aesthetic value)
2. Different levels can have different number of balls, speed of ball etc
3. Acheivements can be added (100% accuracy, discovering easter eggs etc)
